On 'Justine' I have found one jumpfuel. Now I am able to leave this system.
Just want to check last ship here 'Quiet Cruise'. Jeff had sensor issues again.
I think this module isn't reliable any more. Should replace as soon as I find one.<<END LOG

Last wrecks almost killed me. No fuel. No drons. Nothing.
I have lost Chappy. Those damn nanobots broke thorugh the shield.
They were not like I've seen before. Some new form. In the shiplog I have found information
about trading and military outposts in 'Zetta' system. I have jumpfuel left for one more jump.
I will go to 'Zetta' system and try to find new drones and replacement for broken parts.
Maybe I'll meet other survivors there or at least find out what happened...<<END LOG
