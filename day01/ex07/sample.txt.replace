Loreipm Ipsuipm is siipmply duipmipmy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Loreipm Ipsuipm has been the industry's standard duipmipmy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scraipmbled it to ipmake a type speciipmen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, reipmaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Loreipm Ipsuipm passages, and ipmore recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Loreipm Ipsuipm.
